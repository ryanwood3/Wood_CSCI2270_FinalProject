Final Project

For my final project, I will be working alone.  I plan on taking the idea used in the zombie cities assignment and expand upon it.  Instead of having cities in different districts, I will instead create an airline.  The airline will have some cities that are connected and can be flown to while other cities cannot be.  Then, when the user runs the code, they can type in their start and end city and will be given different routes that they could take to get to their destination.  These routes would be found based upon the total price to fly to your destination, the shortest distance traveled, the least amount of layovers, excetera.  I could also add functions that have to do with different fees the airport can impose such as baggage fees, and it could also be expanded to give a list of times for flights so that the user could sign up for their perfect flight quickly and easily.  This would be interesting to construct because it could accomplish similar tasks that actual airlines' programs accomplish.
