Final Project

Description:  I took assignment 12 and expanded upon it.  Instead of just creating a hash table with movies in it.  I created an entire movie store, where you can search for movies, find their information, rent movies, buy movies, and even manage the store.  When the program begins it prompts the user for a text file of the movie's stock.  From there you can either insert movies into the stock, or have the stock be based upon the text file that was read in.  You may also delete movies from the stock.  On the other end, you may search through the movies, print out a list of all of them, alphabetize the list, and view your shopping cart of the movies you have rented and bought as well as the total cost.  Within the FinalProject file there are all the files you need to run my code.
HashTable.cpp contains the functions to run the program
HashTable.h is the header file
main.cpp is the driver file
MovieStock.txt has information on movies so that they can quickly be read into the hash table.  In the text file each line must contain the title followed by the year followed by quantity and then price all separated by commas.

How to run:  In order to run, you can download the file and run through code bock.  When prompted for a text file you can use MovieStock.txt if you wish, but you do not have to.  Alternately, you can compile HashTable.cpp, HashTable.h, and main.cpp as well as any text file you want to use.  You are free to use my MovieStock.txt.  Other than that there are no command line arguments you simply run the program and follow the prompts.  If you wish to use a text file to quickly create you movie stock, you simply input the name text file at the beginning of the program.

Dependencies: The text file, if you wish to use one, must be in the same directory as you program in order to run.  My program doesn't allow you to include any file with its path

System Requirements:  The program was created in Linux, but should run on any operating system.  No system requirements.

Group Members: None, I worked alone.

Contributors: None

Known Bugs: None that I know of yet
